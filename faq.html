                    <p>NALathletics is a European-style "pyramid" of leagues, starting with local & regional leagues and growing to national leagues. If you know what the FA Cup is, you know exactly what we're talking about. If not, think of minor league baseball in the US, from summer ball and the Grapefruit leagues through Single-A, Double-A and Triple-A.</p>

                    <p>A lot happens between a thrower's release and when the implement lands. Fans, coaches and athletes might want to see a detailed replay like they do when watching tennis, baseball or many other sports, on top of knowing how far the hammer, discus, shot or javelin went. </p>
                    <p>Athletics could use some computer vision help. Our do-it-at-home DIY activity introduces young people to the ideas behind computer vision applications in sports. All you need are a few things you might already have around the house, and you can move us closer to knowing everything that happens between the circle and the ground.</p>
