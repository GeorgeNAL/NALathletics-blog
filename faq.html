If you know what the FA Cup is, you know exactly what we're talking about. If not, think of minor league baseball in the US, from summer ball and the Grapefruit leagues through Single-A, Double-A and Triple-A.</p>

                            throwers and the runners going somewhere else altogether. Go for the win and fight for the league title. Our format and structure makes athletics matches (not "track meets")

                            The events are the same. Not every match will have every event, but the events are what makes athletics, athletics.
                            <br><br>Our competitive format is different in the scoring, which emphasizes the team above the individual athletes and enables a
                            team-and-league structure. <br><br>The format and structure go hand-in-hand with our business model; and our brand is based on putting as
                            much distance as possible between us and traditional track & field, so we can take our place with all the other successful sports out there.

                            they have to pay to join those leagues, to cover things like facility rental, uniforms and insurance? Hm. <br><br>So WTH kind of question is it
                            to ask how much our athletes will get paid? Yeah, we know, it's a T&F thing.<br><br>But one thing we have a strong record of is sponsorships.
                            We'll do everything we can to keep costs as low as possible and provide as much good stuff (uniforms, gear, networking / professional
                            opportunities) as we can, which will be more than 99.9% of T&F athletes in the US currently bring in (low bar, we know).
                            <br><br>And for the semi-pro / regional players, within a couple years we'll have something to talk about. Until then - in fact, even then -
