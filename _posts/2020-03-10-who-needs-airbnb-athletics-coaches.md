<h2>Who needs the AirBnB of athletics?</h2>

When I described this project to a friend and one-time collaborator, looking for his feedback, the first question he asked was “Once people find their track stadium, how do you get them to come back to the map again?” 100% the sort of absolutely obvious, silencing, deflating feedback I knew I could count on a Silicon Valley marketing guy for. 

The quick answer was that people would come back to leave their reviews, upload pictures and share their Stories on the other side of the site. A long conversation ensued along the lines of “No, really. How do you make the map more than one-and-done?”

Weeks later, a few conversations with some other people helped me realize that my answer should have started with the two words I rely on most when I’m wearing my coaching pants: It depends.

How do we get people to come back to the map for a second, third or fourth time? It depends on who we’re talking about.

<h3>Coaches, athletic directors and facility managers</h3>

Like most of my other ideas, I straight ripped off the AirBnB comparison from someone I talked to who said the system he built and ultimately sold off was “the AirBnB of [his sport].” I think NALAthletics’ map makes the point even better because we’re talking about places, whereas theirs is more about people. 

The next step, then, falls to the “landlords” of the athletics facilities to create a market for what they are sitting on.

Track & field programs get cut for the simple reason that they cost a lot of money for little to no return. Within the circle of track & field, coaches have job security based on how well their teams and athletes do. But within the broader world of athletics departments, track & field coaches have no job security because no track & field program gives the accountants any reason to keep the program alive. The more track & field programs can do to alleviate the financial burden they place on their departments and schools, the less reason anyone will have to cut the program.  

Every dollar a program can bring in is one less dollar the school or school district doesn’t have to spend on a program the administrators may not want and probably can’t justify. 

NALAthetics’ is a way for coaches and athletic directors to put their track in the shop window. When a local club needs a new home or a meet needs a venue, NALAthletics is there for the AirBnB thing. The better the pictures and information provided, the more appealing a stadium will be to a potential client. Feedback can help facility managers target maintenance and upgrades, and the possibility of negative feedback impacting a potential revenue stream should impel the facility to make the necessary changes. If they don’t, well, we’ll help whoever’s looking find someplace better. 

In this sense, we’re more like Yelp: if reputation and revenue streams mean anything to you, you better keep an eye on what people are saying about you here.
