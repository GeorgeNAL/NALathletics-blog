<h6>Big 10 football players' parents are petitioning the conference to reinstate the fall season. Cross-country and track & field athletes, whose sports are dependent on football, should throw their support behind these very public efforts.</h6>

Cross-country parents and football parents probably don’t have any chances to interact at the college level, but parents of Big 12 XC/TF athletes - and the athletes themselves - should join whatever Facebook group the parents of Ohio State, Penn State, University of Iowa and [University of Nebraska football players](https://www.outkick.com/justin-fields-and-nebraska-football-parents-latest-to-ask-big-ten-to-reverse-decision/) are using to organize their open letters.

By speaking out on behalf of their football-playing sons (and in their capacity as particularly self-interested football-loving fans), these parent groups are inadvertently taking a stronger stand on behalf of collegiate cross-country and track & field than anyone in those sports ever will, or have the platform to do so. ‘Course, arguably, it’s a stronger stand than collegiate cross country and track & field deserve. File that under “For elsewhere.”

Thirteen of the 14 cross-country / track & field programs in the Big 10 (math is obviously not their strong suit) runs at a deficit, ranging from University of Maryland’s [$1.5 million shortfall](https://ope.ed.gov/athletics/) to University of Nebraska conferring an additional meaning to the name “Big Red” with a $6.2 million loss. 

Only Rutgers balances the books for XC/TF. Still not a profit. Just not a loss.

Fortunately for track & field and all the other non-revenue generating sports, Big 10 football programs make so much money that 12 of the 14 athletic departments as a whole turn a profit. UMD and Rutgers break even.

And when we say “all the other non-revenue generating sports,” what we really mean is: just about all other sports are non-revenue generating. Other than football and basketball, only three out of the 204 sports programs in the Big 10 bring in net cash: volleyball at the University of Nebraska and Purdue, and wrestling at the University of Iowa.

Non-football [sports' reliance on football](https://blog.nalathletics.com/2020/08/04/pac-12-track-and-field-football-player-demands) is even more severe among the Power 5 conferences than in the collegiate system as a whole. Football’s financial power lets the NCAA’s best [track & field programs discard any sense of financial responsibility](https://blog.nalathletics.com/2020/06/11/collegiate-spending-track-and-field-governing-bodies) and run seven-figure deficits. The other sports take advantage of this, too, but track & field is almost always the most profligate.

Perhaps instead of signing petitions that no one will heed and making social media <em>cris de couer</em> that won’t be heard out of their single-sport bubble, cross-country and track & field athletes at Big 10 schools and their parents should co-sign the letters everyone in the sports world is reading this week urging the Big 10 to reconsider their decision.

It’s quite easy to ignore track & field. Everyone already does it. But when the football world speaks, people listen. Track & field should support their gridiron benefactor out of self-interest, as much as any sort of school and department solidarity.
